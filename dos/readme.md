<h2>DOS malware</h2>

<br>In this folder you will find the following types of malware:

* **Boot viruses**
These viruses replaced the boot program on the floppy disks and hard drives, infecting the very storage medium itself. There will be samples of different kinds here. Most commonly, there will be boot sector or master boot record samples. These are 512 bytes long. But there will also be some full floppy images in raw (.bin) or teledisk (.td0) formats. There will also be dropper executables - some viruses come with "installers" designed to write them to diskette.

* **File infectors**
These viruses injected themselves into legitimate programs, or otherwise manipulated the operating system into getting executed as part of regular program execution. Most of these will either be DOS COM (.vom) or DOS EXE (.vxe) files.

* **Multipartite viruses**
These viruses used a combination of the above (both boot and file infection). In these cases, the boot instance of the virus will be found in the boot folder, and file instance in the file folders.
