<h2>DOS malware</h2>

<br>In this folder you will find the following types of malware:

* **Boot viruses**
These viruses replaced the boot program on the floppy disks and hard drives, infecting the very storage medium itself.

* **File infectors**
These viruses injected themselves into legitimate programs, or otherwise manipulated the operating system into getting executed as part of regular program execution.

* **Multipartite viruses**
These viruses used a combination of the above (both boot and file infection). In these cases, the boot instance of the virus will be found in the boot folder, and file instance in the file folders.
