> **2.1. The first Bulgarian virus**<br>
>At that time both known viruses that infected files (Vienna and Cascade) infected only COM files. This made us believe that the infection of EXE files was much more difficult. Unfortunately, we made the mistake of telling our opinion to a friend of ours. Let's call him "V.B." for privacy reasons.

>(These are the initials of his true name. It will be the same with the other virus writers that we shall mention here. Please note, that while we have the same initials - and even his full name resembles ours - we are two different persons.)

>The challenge was taken immediately and soon after that we received a simple virus that was able to infect only EXE files. It is now known to the world under the name of **Old Yankee**. The reason for this is that when the virus infects a new file, it plays the "Yankee Doodle" melody.

>The virus itself was quite trivial. Its only feature was its ability to infect EXE files. The author of this virus even distributed its source code (or, more exactly, the source code of the program that releases it). Nevertheless, the virus did not spread very widely and even had not been modified a lot. Only a few sites reported to be infected by it. Probably the reason for this was the fact, that the virus was non-resident and that it infected files only on the current drive. So the only possibility to get infected by it was to copy an infected file from one computer to another.

>When the puzzle of creating a virus which is able to infect EXE files was solved, V.B. lost his interest in this field and didn't write any other viruses. As far as we know, he currently works in the area of real-time signal processing.
