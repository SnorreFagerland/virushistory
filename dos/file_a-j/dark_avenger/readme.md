>**2.3. The Dark Avenger**<br>
>In the spring of 1989 a new virus appeared in Bulgaria. It was obviously "home-made" and just to remove any doubts about it, there was a string in it, saying "This program was written in the city of Sofia (C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger".

>The virus was incredibly infectious when it was in memory, it was sufficient to copy or just to open a file to get it infected. When the user felt that there is a virus in his/her system and, without booting from a non-infected write-protected system diskette, ran an anti-virus program which wasn't aware of this new virus, he usually got all his/her executable files infected.

>The idea of infecting a file when it is opened was new and really "successful". Nowadays such viruses are called "fast infectors". This infection strategy helped the virus to spread world-wide. There were infection reports from all European countries, from the USA, the USSR, even from Thailand and Mongolia.

>On the top of this, the virus was very dangerously destructive. On each 16th run of an infected program, it overwrote a sector at a random place of the disk, thus possibly destroying the file or directory that contained this sector. The contents of the overwritten sector was the first 512 bytes of the virus body, so even after the system had been cleaned up, there were files, containing a string "Eddie lives...somewhere in time!" This was causing much more damage than if the virus was just formatting the hard disk, since the destruction was very unnoticable and when the user eventually discovered it, his/her backups probably already contained corrupted data.

>Soon after that, other clever viruses began to appear. Almost all of them were very destructive. Several contained completely new ideas. Now this person (we still cannot identify him exactly) is believed to be the author of the following viruses:

>Dark Avenger, V2000 (two variants), V2100 (two variants), 651, Diamond (two variants), Nomenklatura, 512 (six variants), 800, 1226, Proud, Evil, Phoenix, Anthrax, Leech...

>Dark Avenger has several times attacked some anti-virus researchers personally. The V2000/V2100 viruses claim to be written by "Vesselin Bontchev" and in fact hang the computer when any program, containing this string is run. A slightly modified variant of V2100 (V2100-B) has been used to trojanize version 66 of John McAfee's package VirusScan.

>There are reports that Dark Avenger has called several bulletin board systems in Europe and has uploaded there viruses. The reports come from the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, Greece... Sometimes the viruses uploaded there are unknown in Bulgaria (e.g., Nomenklatura, Anthrax). But they are obviously made in our country - they contain messages in Cyrillic. Sometimes Dark Avenger uploads a Trojan program which releases a virus - not just an infected program. This makes the detection of the source of infection more difficult.

>In one particular case he has uploaded a file called UScan, which, when run, claims to be the "universal virus scanner", written by Vesselin Bontchev. Even the person who has uploaded it, has logged under the name "Vesselin Bontchev". In fact, the program just infected all scanned files with the Anthrax virus.

>While the other Bulgarian virus writers seem to be just irresponsible or with childish mentality, the Dark Avenger can be classified as a "technopath". He is a regular user of several Bulgarian bulletin board systems, so one can easily exchange e-mail messages with him. When asked why his viruses are destructive, he replied that "destroying data is a pleasure" and that he "just loves to destroy other people's work".

>Unfortunately, no measures can be taken against him in Bulgaria. Since there is no law for information protection, his activities are not illegal there. He can be easily caught by tapping the phones of the BBSes that he uses, but the law enforcement authorities cannot take such measures, since there is no evidence of illegal activities. Alas, he knows this perfectly.
