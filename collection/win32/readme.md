<h2>32-bit Windows malware</h2>

I will normally not add Win32 malware in this repo, since these usually are runnable on modern Windows. However, some malware are important from a historical point of view, and I **may** add some of those. In these cases, the samples will always either be defanged/archived, or of a format that is not runnable by accident.
