Orgasmatron
===========

Author: Vecna/29A  
Origin: Brazil  
Native of: DOS platform  
Objects: boot sectors  
Residency: int 1, int 8  
Behavior: this is world's first boot virus which uses 386+ PMODE features
          and which does not hook int 13h in order to infect. Orgasmatron
          first checks for a 386+ processor by means of int 6, and if all
          is ok it will hook int 8 (in order to keep int 1 untouched) and
          int 1, which will receive the control whenever it's called from
          the DR3 debug breakpoint in order to infect boot sectors.
