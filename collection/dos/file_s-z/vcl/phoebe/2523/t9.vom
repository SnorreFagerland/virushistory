Phoebe: high school knockout, better take our MONDAY to
the tuesday prize fighter(you were a cab driver off on
the distance).youre a runner or a lover:sacred taylor
set our records straight one lost two late,im a little
off time so set your ticker to mine:
id love to have my halo of social grace recrowned.
(desert island ect.) home to ill will and
misrepresentation. barter with me now mexico, i demand
it.come bluebeard & red blood-we are life-even in our
tied down mishaps. we are life; endure us. dead seven
year old run over by a bus while stealing your first
and only bicycle; endure. this is life even in my wine
glass even in my ever faltering and constant doubt we
are here, this is it, endure. even in on our toilet
in the morning or in your shitbox or motel, you have
made it-rejoice!-the ground will open up on us even
before this glass is finished. this year will end for
most of us.salt touches the ground, athens have we
lost quite yet? savagly speared we went down quietly?
giving up our youth or even worse our spirit so
daintily as a beauty queen shits at midnight? was no
one watching? listening? tell me athens: are we
christians and lions? have i got my history all wrong?
from the first to the last or one year past: "are these
the depths of despair so unevenly documented in its
text?".for once athens history repeats itself.tell me
what do you think of our football games? are our glory
days over? is america doomed with pre-ejaculation? i
must know. slap me and tell me im like all the rest,
athens,id feel so much better if you did.am i a thief
stealing red robed memory? am i: train through a
tunnel? rocketship blasting off? the washington
monument? i bet i am.i am wimpering under your window
sill or whispering to your pillowed ear:rejoice! we are
famous watchers.sewer of amber letters, lips sewed a
thread of truth to your tongue.i named and numbered my
system the whole world over,and you?you got flowers and
chocolates.like a steel warehouse summer turned calcium
to carbon.
