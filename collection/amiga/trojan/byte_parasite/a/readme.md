     Comments     : This Virus is very LAME coded. You always  will get a
                    GURU if you sarting it. I don`t know exactly what the
                    virus should does. The  only  thing  I can  say about 
                    this try  of a Bomb  is that it  exchanges bytes from
                    the CLI-Commands "CD", "DIR" and of the "STARTUP-SEQ"
                    But like above mentioned the virus will always end in
                    a GURU, so I can`t  tell you exactly what it does. If
                    your disk is Write-Protected a System-Request appears
