<h2>Dronebot family</h2>

This is a very large family of similar clone IRC scripts, minimally changed by loads of people. The family is usually detected by antivirus products as Zapchast, but this is imprecise, as that is a generic detection that covers a lot of different malware. I have just called them dronebot for this repo, as they clearly are related, though I don't think it makes sense to give them unique variable names for every byte difference.
