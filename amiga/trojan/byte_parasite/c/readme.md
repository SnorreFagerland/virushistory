     Comments     : After you started the  ByteParasite 3 the virus opens
                    a window with the title:

                    "Virus-Checker V3.0 by Michael Ortmanns"

                    NOW, the virus tries  to open df0:c/Virus-Checker. If
                    this  programm  exist, the  virus  copies  itself  to
                    df1:c/Virus-Checker.  Additionally  the virus patches
                    the following verctors: KICK, Cool & $6C.w Interrupt.
                    These patches causes trips to india (GURU).
                    The  ByteParasite  Viruses  are  very boring  and bad 
                    coded. Look above and you will  see what I mean. Just
                    imagine the user  haven`t got a  second  drive (DF1:)
                    then the  System will pop up a  requester telling you
                    to insert DF1.  You can`t  say  more  about such damn
                    viruses like the Byte Parasite.
