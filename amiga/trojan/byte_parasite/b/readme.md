     Comments     : If you are starting the bomb it opens a Window:

                    "VirusX: Checking Device DF0:"

                    After that it tries to open "DF0:c/VirusX" if existing
                    the virus  creates "DF1:c/VirusX". This  new VirusX is
                    1  byte  long   and  contains  the  value 0.  I  don`t 
                    understand for what  this  Bomb  is used for. Maybe to
                    damage a special person ?!?!
