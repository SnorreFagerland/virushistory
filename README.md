<h1>A museum of malicious software from the DOS era</h1>

**NONE OF THESE FILES CAN EXECUTE OR HARM MODERN OPERATING SYSTEMS**

(That does not mean you should be careless around unverified content. Always use a VM if you want to research these files).


The period from mid-1980'ies until the end of the century was an incredibly important period in cybersecurity. 



Nowadays, malware are commercial tools of theft and fraud - commoditized, automated and churned out in millions of samples.
Although some of them break new ground, 99.99% of them are uninteresting and discardable.



*However, the early malwares weren't*. They often explored entirely new concepts and weaknesses. They were sometimes pranks. They were sometimes social statements or personal posturing. They often showed messages or had screen effects. And a handful were destructive. In this era, we saw replicating software - what became known as computer viruses - that targeted multiple operating systems and platforms. There were huge computer worms, traversing networks. There were destructive programs, the origin of the moniker 'trojans'. Within replicating malware, we had several classes:

* **Boot viruses**
These viruses replaced the boot program on the floppy disks and hard drives, infecting the very storage medium itself

* **File infectors**
These viruses injected themselves into legitimate programs. File infectors exist for all major operating systems. In this collection, the majority will be DOS file infectors. These can no longer execute on modern operating systems.

* **Multipartite viruses**
These viruses used a combination of the above (both boot and file infection).
  
* **Macro viruses**
These viruses infect file formats that support macro scripting, typically (but not limited to) Microsoft Office documents.


**The history is fading out.** 

These old files are leaking out of history, though bitrot, deletion and unindexing. My own collection was added to the Norwegian AV company Norman when I joined them in 1998 - and The Norman file database was many years later just deleted when the company was acquired, files by then irrelevant for the product. Many of the old virus files may still be located in other antivirus companies vaults but they'll be hashes among billions of hashes, all context gone, and worse than useless.




<h2>What this collection contains</h2>

In the period from 1990 to 1998, I was incredibly interested in the computer virus phenomenon. I developed a database system called AVID (AV-ID, get it?) to compare detections between different antivirus products, a sort of pre-VirusTotal comparison mechanism. As part of this project, I built a computer virus collection that rivaled many AV products in scope. Remember, this was before the incredible proliferation and automation of the 2000's. Viruses were manageable. To make sure the detections were consistent, I also personally maintained, analyzed and replicated most viruses.  

As I mentioned, I gave my collection to Norman when I joined them. HOWEVER: I saved a backup on IOMega ZIP drives, stored them in the basement and forgot about them. I stumbled upon them when cleaning up earlier this year. I had to buy a used drive online (god knows where my old drive is), but luckily it worked, and I was able to restore the collection with just a minimum of read errors.

This collection is what I am now making available. It won't be relevant for most of you. You won't learn much with regards to modern day cybersecurity. But of you are an uber-geek, interested in concepts and history, then this collection is for you.
