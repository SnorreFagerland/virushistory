<h2>Commodore 64 as a target</h2>
<br>
While surely not the most popular platform anymore, there actually are viruses written for the Commodore 64. <br>
Posts on the old C64 mailing list describe a handful, such as Bula, HIV and BHP.<br><br>

**Bula** <br>
These are viruses likely originating in Poland. There's a [virus encyclopedia entry](http://virus.wikidot.com/bula), and the incredible Cesare Pizzi did a proper analysis and presented on DEFCON30.<br><br>
