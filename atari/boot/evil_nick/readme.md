Remarks :  Contains the text " EVIL ! - A Gift from Old Nick". It is written in England.  Obviously,  the author acquired a copy of an earlier version of the "Ultimate Virus Killer" - he made sure the 
virus  was recognized to be an Atari system  disk! Very cleverly done, by using the recognition bytes somewhere in the virus code. I  am glad to say that we're now at least ONE step ahead of this
guy! This virus is very often found in Scandinavian countries.
