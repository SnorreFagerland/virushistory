Remark :  This  virus  was  featured in  a  German  magazine  called  
 "Computer  & Technik".  The author claims he 'found it' on one  of  
 his disks. A listing was included, so that people could  reproduce 
 and adapt the virus with ease.  It writes the message  "ARRRGGGHHH 
 Diskvirus  hat  wieder  zugeschlagen" on the screen   when  it  is 
 activated. Due to the fact that it forgets to check whether or not 
 the  device is higher than "B",  it can also copy itself  to  hard 
 disk (which will most likely cause permanent damage).<br>
