Remark : RUMOURED  to be made by someone called Pash in Doncaster, England. It is very widely spread (England, Holland, Sweden and West Germany in particular).  It is also called "Mouse" virus and "Inversion" virus.<br>

**Name : Ghost Virus B.**<br>
Discovery date : June 15th 1989 (R. de Groen).<br>
Symptoms :  See  above (Ghost Virus).  This virus has a few damaged bytes and will therefore crash easily.<br>

**Name : Ghost Virus C.**<br>
Discovery date : March 9th 1990.<br>
Remark : A version of the original Ghost Virus in which three bytes have been corrupted, causing the branch to be (non-fatally) misled and the mouse reversion routine to malfunction. It copies without any problems, though, and is indeed reset-proof.
