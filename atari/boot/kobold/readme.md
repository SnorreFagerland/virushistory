**Name : Kobold #2 Virus A.**<br>
Type : Reset-proof memory-resident bootsector virus.<br>
Discovery date : January 2nd 1989.<br>
Virus can copy to drive(s) : A (?).<br>
Virus attaches itself to : Hdv_bpb and resvector; Vbl_queue; also undocumented reset-resistant. <br>
Disks can be immunized against it : No.<br>
Immunizable with UVK : No.<br>
What can happen: The mouse UP and LEFT directions will be slightly distorted, resulting in the user slowly moving it off the desk. <br>
When does that happen : Whenever XBIOS functions are called.<br>
Reset-proof : Yes.<br>
Can copy to hard disk : No.<br>
Remark: This is the toughest virus yet. Not many statements can be made about it with certainty. It installs itself in memory on booting, and only after ANOTHER reset will it install the vectors 
mentioned above. Then, it will also print the text "KOBOLD#2 AKTIV!" (this leads to the belief that the virus is German). Confusingly, there is also a "Kobold AntiVirus". This is a "virus 
free" disk written by the German fast file copy program  "Kobold". It is no true Antivirus.
